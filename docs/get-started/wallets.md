# Wallets

The Growth DAO manages two main wallets: the Validator wallet and the Multisig wallet.

## Validator

The DAO validator operates on a cluster with 3 active nodes and 3 signers. All commissions are set to 100%, meaning the rewards are either redelegated or used to support DAO initiatives. If you'd like to support the DAO further, you can join the discussions or contribute using P2P tokens.
