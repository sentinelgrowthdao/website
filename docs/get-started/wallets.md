# Wallets

The Growth DAO possesses and oversees various wallets, and for the sake of transparency, they are all detailed on this page.

## DAO Validator

The DAO validator is currently active with a 100% commission. The rewards will either be redelegated or used for the DAO initiatives. Anyone interested in further supporting the DAO can do so through discussions or by using DVPN coins.
