# IBC Relayer

In the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, relayers play a crucial role in facilitating the reliable and secure transfer of data packets between different blockchains. IBC is designed to enable permissionless and trustless communication among blockchains, allowing for a variety of interchain services. One of the key functions of relayers is to ensure the smooth flow of packets over network infrastructure.

Sentinel Growth DAO relayer will manage the relaying of Sentinel, Atom, Axelar and Osmosis through the IBC infrastructure. Yovan, representing Busurnode, will be responsible for overseeing the relayers' operations to ensure the seamless and permissionless transfer of data packets across the designated blockchains.
