# Validator

The DAO validator operates on a cluster with 3 active nodes and 3 signers. All commissions are set to 100%, meaning the rewards are either redelegated or used to support DAO initiatives. If you'd like to support the DAO further, you can join the discussions or contribute using P2P tokens.

Yovan, representing Busurnode, will be responsible for overseeing its maintenance, ensuring the implementation of essential monitoring measures. The private key associated with the DAO Validator has been securely distributed among the DAO members.
